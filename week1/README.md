Repository for the course Real Time Web for the minor Web Development at the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam. 

# Chat app
This week I created a chat app with `socket.io` and `node.js`, the app enables users to chat in real time. The browser does not have to be reloaded. 

I used two tutorials to help me with the code:

- [Socket.io Chat App Using Websockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHbCkikFfDE)
- [Get Started: Chat application](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

# Using the app
The app is not yet deployed, to access it clone this repository and navigate to the folder in your terminal.

Run `$node app.js`
Go to: http://localhost:3004
